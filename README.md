`experiment_buddy` aims to reduce the overhead to deploy experiments on servers.

Aims to reducing the cognitive load of running experiments remotely: with minimal changes it removes the need to think about experiment deployment for common use cases.

buddy is a work in progress, if you are intrerested in using it in your workflow, ping me in slack @delvermm

It's important to reduce cognitive overload for the researcher, as measured in seconds-to-first-tensorboard-datapoint.

Right now its responsibilities cover:
1. Deployment on servers
1. Handling of Sweeps
1. Tracking of hyperparameters
1. Code versioning
1. Notifications
1. Wandb integration.

Example: (Updated)

# Quick start with Buddy cli

## Requirements

1. You now need to setup the cluster SSH key. how create and add your SSH keys can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) 
1. Add cluster public-key to: `https://github.com/settings/keys` if you don't know this yet, check this out [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
1. `pip install wandb && wandb init` there are two ways to set up wandb: 
    - set up wandb init from the cmd
    - or set export  WANDB_API_KEY = your wandb key which can be found here: https://wandb.ai/settings


## Installation
### From repo
```shell
git clone git@github.com:ministry-of-silly-code/buddy_cli.git
pip install -e ./buddy-cli
```

### Directly from pip
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/ministry-of-silly-code/buddy_cli.git@master\#egg\=buddy_cli
```

## Usage
### Interactive
```shell
buddy-init --dest <your_awesome_project>
cd <your_awesome_project>
```

### With options
```shell
buddy-init --dest <your_awesome_project> -y --setup_mila_user <your_awesome_user>
cd <your_awesome_project>
```

### Help
```shell
buddy-init --help
```

Once the setup is done you can also login with your Mila account on the cluster with `ssh -F ~/.ssh/config_mila mila`

# To run your code locally

Start by forking the example repo https://github.com/ministry-of-silly-code/examples

```shell
# 1 - Go to your 
cd <your_awesome_project>

# Run your experiments
python ./mnist_classifier.py
```
